This is a example program about accelate the progress of learning the model
We refer the course of Michael Nielsen(http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html)

To run the program, we suggest that you shold use the python2.7
and run test.py, where LearningQ in single_layer is the function which
optimize the model based on the quadratic cost function.
On the contrast, LearningCE function employ cross-entroy as cost function.
